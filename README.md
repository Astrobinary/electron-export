## Overview:
#### Main component:
Get job location and display basic information
    
#### Interface:
Options: r tags toggle, TOC header toggle, save location, EDGAR shading toggle
Buttons: Start/Stop, validate links/images

#### Logic
On start: Run command to generate XML from XPP project then pass it to JSON transformer to save in global state. Handlebar reads from state and copies locally to modify and properly template html.

### XPP XML command:
`divxml -job -nol â€“ncrh -wpi -xsh`

## HTML TODO:

#### Bugs
- Rules don't appear at times (nt10002006x1_424b5-FILED)


#### Text
- Normalize checkbox sizes
- Calculate block distances

#### Tables
- Headers last column does not need ch spacing
- Handle EDGAR shading exceptions.
- Handle rule exceptions.
- Generate vertical rules.
- Check if <br> should be added by checking if next line element is on the same x cord.

#### House Only
- Special regcov rules to ignore vertical spacing.
- Hanging characters on tables. (Noticeable with EDGAR shading)

#### Other
- Properly handle red herring.
- Calc table rules

#### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.

#### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
