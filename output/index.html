        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">This proxy statement relates to a special meeting of stockholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (‘‘Wabtec’’) to approve the proposals described herein with respect to the merger (the ‘‘Merger’’) of Wabtec US Rail Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘Merger Sub’’), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec, with and into Transportation Systems Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘SpinCo’’), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Company (‘‘GE’’), whereby the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and SpinCo will continue as the surviving company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec. SpinCo will file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘‘SEC’’) to register shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, certain of which common shares will be distributed to GE stockholders prior to the Merger. In the Merger, the shares of SpinCo common stock held by GE and GE stockholders will be converted into the right to receive shares of Wabtec common stock. In addition, Wabtec has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-227444) with the SEC to register the shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that will be issued in the Merger. The Merger will be preceded by a direct sale of certain assets of GE Transportation (the ‘‘Direct Sale’’) from GE to Wabtec US Rail, Inc. (the ‘‘Direct Sale Purchaser’’) in exchange for a cash payment of $2.9 billion. Concurrently, the Direct Sale Purchaser will assume certain liabilities of GE Transportation in connection with the Direct Sale. GE and Wabtec may elect, in an economically equivalent structure, to reduce the assets included in the Direct Sale by $25 million and, in such event, GE would contribute such assets to SpinCo and would receive shares of non-voting preferred stock in SpinCo (the ‘‘SpinCo preferred stock’’) in the SpinCo Transfer in addition to the SpinCo common stock that GE will otherwise be receiving in the SpinCo Transfer. If GE and Wabtec make such an election, the Direct Sale Price would be reduced by $25 million. The SpinCo preferred stock would not be distributed in the Distribution or converted in the Merger and, accordingly, would remain outstanding as stock of SpinCo and held by GE immediately following the effective time of the Merger. The SpinCo preferred stock would pay cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate, and have other terms, to be agreed by GE and Wabtec that would be intended to result in the fair market value of the SpinCo preferred stock equaling its face value. At any time after the seventh anniversary of the effective time of the Merger, SpinCo would be permitted (but would not be obligated) to redeem the SpinCo preferred stock for a per share redemption price (including an amount in satisfaction of any accrued and unpaid dividends).</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Based on market conditions prior to the closing of the Merger, corporate finance considerations and timing considerations, GE will determine whether the shares of SpinCo common stock that will be distributed to GE stockholders will be distributed in a spin-off or a split-off. In a spin-off, all GE stockholders would receive from GE, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, a number of shares of SpinCo common stock constituting not less than 80.25% of the outstanding shares of SpinCo common stock (the ‘‘Distribution Shares’’). In a split-off, GE would offer its stockholders the option to exchange shares of GE common stock for shares of SpinCo common stock in an exchange offer, resulting in a reduction in GE’s outstanding shares. If the exchange offer is undertaken and consummated, the remaining Distribution Shares, if any, would be distributed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to GE stockholders whose shares of GE common stock remain outstanding after the consummation of the exchange offer. Immediately following the consummation of the spin-off or split-off, as the case may be, and in connection with the Merger, the shares of SpinCo held by GE and GE stockholders will be converted into the right to receive shares of Wabtec common stock in the Merger. This proxy statement and Wabtec’s registration statement on Form S-4 assume that the Distribution Shares will be distributed to GE stockholders pursuant to a spin-off. In addition, SpinCo has filed a registration statement on Form 10 (No. 000-55990) to register the Distribution Shares under the assumption that such shares of SpinCo common stock will be distributed to GE stockholders pursuant to a spin-off. GE may make its final decision as to whether the SpinCo common stock will be distributed in a spin-off or split-off after the date of the special meeting. </div>

Because banks, brokers and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement, if you fail to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions with respect to your shares held in ‘‘street name’’ with respect to at least one of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. Accordingly, there will be no broker non-votes and shares held in ‘‘street name’’ will not be voted on any of the proposals unless the bank, broker or other nominee has received voting instructions from its customer with respect to such proposal.</div>

This means at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock entitled to vote on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. You are considered a part of the quorum if you vote over the Internet, by telephone or by submitting a properly signed proxy card. If you are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Because banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of common stock in ‘‘street name’’ on behalf of beneficial owners do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares held in ‘‘street name’’ with respect to at least one of the proposals means your shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and will not be counted toward determining whether a quorum exists. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Wabtec to additional expense.</div>

Because Wabtec stockholders will not participate in the Distribution, the Merger or the Direct Sale, Wabtec stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss as a result of such transactions. Wabtec stockholders should consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences to them of the Distribution, the Merger and the Direct Sale.

Immediately after consummation of the Merger, and calculated on a fully-diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis, pre-Merger Wabtec stockholders will continue to own shares in Wabtec, which will include GE Transportation as it exists following the Separation, constituting 49.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec stockholders will not receive separate merger consideration as part of the Merger and no additional shares of Wabtec common stock will be issued to Wabtec stockholders pursuant to the Merger. Wabtec stockholders will receive the commercial benefit of Wabtec’s ownership of GE Transportation as it exists following consummation of the Separation. Wabtec stockholders will thus hold an interest in a diversified, global company that is better positioned to meet anticipated growth, including with respect to intelligence and network optimization products and services, and to capitalize on increased opportunities for cross-selling and the provision of aftermarket services, with significant adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth opportunities, strong forecasted future cash flows, anticipated tax benefits, and additional executive management talent.

Wabtec and the other Borrowers entered into the Credit Agreement on June 8, 2018, which includes (i) a $1.2 billion Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) a $350.0 million Refinancing Term Loan and (iii) a $400.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. Wabtec also obtained Bridge Commitments in respect of the Bridge Loan Facility in an amount not to exceed $2.5 billion. On September 14, 2018, in accordance with the Commitment Letter, the Bridge Commitments were permanently reduced to $0 in connection with Wabtec’s issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. Wabtec will use funds available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the proceeds from the issuance of the New Wabtec Notes to pay the Direct Sale Purchase Price. The Credit Agreement is expected to have approximately $812 million of unused availability immediately following consummation of the Transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains an uncommitted accordion feature allowing Wabtec to request, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $600.0 million, increases to the borrowing commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or a new incremental term loan commitment.

Therefore, the voting power represented by the shares of Wabtec common stock held by pre-Merger Wabtec stockholders will be lower immediately following the Merger than immediately prior to the Merger.

The existence of a discount may negatively affect the market price of Wabtec common stock. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a further discussion of the material risks associated with the Transactions. </div>

This additional indebtedness could materially and adversely affect the liquidity, results of operations and financial condition of Wabtec. Wabtec also expects to incur significant one-time costs in connection with the Transactions, which may have an adverse impact on Wabtec’s liquidity, cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are incurred. Finally, Wabtec’s management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of Wabtec’s business and GE Transportation, as it exists following the Separation. If Wabtec management is not able to manage the integration process effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, Wabtec’s business could suffer and its stock price may decline. </div>

Subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as set forth in the Merger Agreement, Wabtec will issue approximately 98.5 million shares of Wabtec common stock in the Merger. Based upon the reported closing sale price of $109.97 per share for Wabtec common stock on the NYSE on August 17, 2018, the total value of the shares of Wabtec common stock to be issued by Wabtec in the Merger would be approximately $10.8 billion, and the cash to be received by GE in the Transactions, including in respect of the Direct Sale, would be approximately $2.9 billion plus any payments GE receives pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement.

Nevertheless, because of the significant assets and operations represented by GE Transportation, Wabtec expects that, following the consummation of the Transaction, SpinCo, Direct Sale Purchaser, and/or other entities through which GE Transportation (as it exists following the Separation) is owned and operated may be required to become guarantors of the indebtedness of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, the New Wabtec Notes and Wabtec’s existing senior unsecured notes.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">A Reverse Morris Trust transaction structure typically allows a parent company (here, GE) to divest a business (here, GE Transportation) tax-efficiently. In a typical Reverse Morris Trust transaction, the parent generally will receive a cash payment from the subsidiary to be spun off (an ‘‘exit dividend’’), usually financed by new borrowings at the subsidiary level, after which the parent will divest stock of the subsidiary (here, SpinCo) through a dividend (a ‘‘spin-off’’) or exchange offer (a ‘‘split-off’’) of the subsidiary stock to parent stockholders. Immediately after the distribution, the subsidiary effects a merger with an unrelated company (here, Wabtec), in a transaction in which the unrelated company’s stockholders will hold less than 50% of the capital stock of the combined company immediately after the transaction. In this regard, the Transactions are similar to a traditional Reverse Morris Trust transaction because they include both GE’s distribution of SpinCo common stock in the Distribution and SpinCo’s substantially simultaneous merger with a subsidiary of Wabtec in the Merger.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">However, the Transactions are referred to in this document as a ‘‘modified’’ Reverse Morris Trust transaction for two reasons. First, unlike in a typical Reverse Morris Trust transaction, GE’s distribution of SpinCo common stock will be preceded by the Direct Sale of certain assets of GE Transportation (and an assumption of certain liabilities of GE Transportation) in exchange for a $2.9 billion cash payment to GE in lieu of an exit dividend from GE Transportation (which would be typical in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction). Second, while a distribution in a typical Reverse Morris Trust transaction would be tax-free to the parent and its stockholders, here the receipt of stock in the Distribution is intended to be tax-free to the GE stockholders but the transaction is intended to be taxable to GE. </div>

The Direct Sale also should reduce administrative complexity and financing costs.</div>

Additionally, in certain circumstances (see ‘‘The Merger Agreement—Post-Closing Wabtec Board of Directors and Officers’’), the Wabtec Board will take all actions necessary to include the GE designee up for reelection at the first annual meeting of Wabtec stockholders that occurs after the closing of the Merger as nominee for the Wabtec Board at such annual meeting, to recommend that Wabtec stockholders vote in favor of the GE designee and to support the election of the GE designee at such annual meeting. The executive officers of Wabtec immediately prior to consummation of the Merger are generally expected to be the executive officers of Wabtec immediately following consummation of the Merger, with Albert J. Neupaver remaining as Wabtec’s executive chairman and Raymond T. Betler remaining as Wabtec’s president and CEO.

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. In applying the acquisition method, it is necessary to identify both the accounting acquiree and the accounting acquiror. In a business combination effected through an exchange of equity interests, such as the Merger, the entity that issues the interests (Wabtec, in this case) is generally the acquiring entity. In identifying the acquiring entity in a combination effected through an exchange of equity interests, however, all pertinent facts and circumstances must be considered, including the following:</div>

Approximately $2.9 billion of indebtedness is expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions to fund the Direct Sale. Following the consummation of the Transactions, it is expected that post-Transaction GE Transportation will be owned by Wabtec through SpinCo, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec and will hold the SpinCo Business, and Direct Sale Purchaser, which will also be a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec and will hold the assets, potentially including the equity interests in certain pre-Transaction subsidiaries of GE that compose part of GE Transportation, acquired in the Direct Sale and the liabilities assumed in the Direct Sale. Nevertheless, because of the significant assets and operations represented by GE Transportation, Wabtec expects that following the consummation of the Transaction, SpinCo, Direct Sale Purchaser, and/or other entities through which GE Transportation is owned and operated may be required to become guarantors of the indebtedness of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, the New Wabtec Notes and Wabtec’s existing senior unsecured notes.</div>

In this case and calculated on a fully-diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis, GE and pre-Merger holders of GE common stock will collectively hold 50.1% of the equity ownership and associated voting rights in Wabtec after the consummation of the Transactions (with approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock expected to be held by GE) and 49.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock will be held by pre-Merger Wabtec stockholders. The shares held by GE will be subject to GE’s obligations under (x) the Tax Matters Agreement to sell a number of shares of Wabtec common stock within two years of the Distribution Date (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Tax Matters Agreement’’) and (y) the Shareholders Agreement to sell, subject to limited exceptions, all of the shares of Wabtec common stock GE beneficially owns within three years of the closing date of the Merger and prior thereto, to vote all of such shares in the proportion required under the Shareholders Agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Shareholders Agreement’’).</div>

The Wabtec Board currently consists of 12 directors. In connection with the Transactions, the size of the Wabtec Board will be increased to include three additional directors, each of whom is required to be independent as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE, to be designated as nominees by GE (subject to the nominees being reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Wabtec Board), effective at the time of closing of the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the direction of GE, the GE designees will be assigned among the Wabtec Board’s classes of directors so that one GE designee is appointed to the class of directors that is up for reelection at each of the first three annual meetings of Wabtec stockholders that occurs after the closing of the Merger. Additionally, in certain circumstances (see ‘‘Merger Agreement – Post-Closing Wabtec Board of Directors and Officers’’), the Wabtec Board will take all actions necessary to include the GE designee up for reelection at the first annual meeting of Wabtec stockholders that occurs after the closing of the Merger as nominee for the Wabtec Board at such annual meeting, to recommend that Wabtec stockholders vote in favor of the GE designee and to support the election of the GE designee at such annual meeting. </div>

The executive officers of Wabtec immediately prior to consummation of the Merger are generally expected to be the executive officers of Wabtec immediately following consummation of the Merger, with Albert J. Neupaver remaining as Wabtec’s executive chairman and Raymond T. Betler remaining as Wabtec’s president and CEO. Following consummation of the Transactions, Stéphane Rambaud-Measson will become president and CEO of Wabtec’s Transit Segment and Rafael O. Santana, president and CEO of GE Transportation, will become president and CEO of Wabtec’s Freight Segment.</div>

Consequently, Wabtec will apply acquisition accounting to the assets and liabilities of GE Transportation acquired or assumed upon the consummation of the Direct Sale and the Merger. The historical financial statements of Wabtec for periods ended prior to the consummation of the Merger will reflect only the operations and financial condition of Wabtec. Subsequent to the consummation of the Merger, the financial statements of Wabtec will include the combined operations and financial condition of Wabtec and GE Transportation.</div>

Wabtec and GE each filed the requisite notification and report forms with the FTC and the DOJ on June 22, 2018. Wabtec and GE have each received a request for additional information (‘‘second request’’) from the DOJ. The second request is not an uncommon part of the regulatory review process under the HSR Act in respect of large transactions. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Wabtec and GE have substantially complied with their respective request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by both parties or terminated sooner by the DOJ. Wabtec and GE will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ as it reviews the proposed transaction. In addition to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the parties have agreed to take, make or obtain all material actions by, consents or approvals of, or in respect of or filings with any governmental authority required to permit the consummation of the Merger, including the governmental authorizations to be sought in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa and Ukraine.

The term sheet was nonbinding except for certain customary binding provisions, including an exclusivity provision under which GE agreed to work exclusively with Wabtec on the possible transaction for 30 days. The term sheet contemplated a possible Reverse Morris Trust transaction for the combination of Wabtec and GE Transportation whereby GE would receive a cash payment from SpinCo in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion and GE stockholders would receive a majority of the combined company’s common stock, with the amount of the cash payment and percentage of common stock being subject to continued discussions. The notion that a portion of the consideration to GE would be payable in cash was part of the parties’ discussions from the outset, in part because such payments are typical in Reverse Morris Trust transactions.</div>

Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Jones Day participated in the meeting. At the meeting, Wabtec’s senior management reviewed the strategic and financial rationale of the possible transaction, the results of due diligence and discussions with GE to date. A representative of Jones Day reviewed the Wabtec directors’ fiduciary duties in the circumstances, the material terms of draft transaction documentation, the major open issues at the time and the major actions involved in the possible transaction. The Transactions were considered by the Wabtec Board at this and subsequent meetings as a potential alternative to Wabtec continuing to operate pursuant to its existing business plan under its existing capital structure. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided a financial review of the possible transaction. Following these discussions, the Wabtec Board directed Wabtec’s management and legal and financial advisors to continue discussions with representatives of GE.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">On May 14, 2018 and May 19, 2018, the Wabtec Board met to review the possible transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Jones Day participated in the meetings. At the May 19, 2018 meeting, Wabtec’s senior management reviewed the strategic and financial rationale of the possible transaction, and the final results of due diligence and economic terms of the possible transaction. A representative of Jones Day reviewed the Wabtec directors’ fiduciary duties in the circumstances, and the material terms of drafts of the principal Transaction Documents. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided a financial review of the possible transaction. At the meeting on May 19, 2018, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Wabtec Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated May 20, 2018, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions as set forth in such written opinion, the Aggregate Consideration to be paid by Wabtec pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Wabtec (See ‘‘The Transactions—Opinion of Wabtec’s Financial Advisor’’). A representative of Jones Day also provided an update on the status of the debt financing (See ‘‘Debt Financing’’), as well as the various Transaction Documents. Following discussions with Wabtec management and Wabtec’s legal and financial advisors, the Wabtec Board unanimously determined that the Transactions, as well as the Wabtec Charter Amendment and the Share Issuance, were advisable and in the best interests of Wabtec and its stockholders, and approved the Transactions and the Transaction Documents, including the Wabtec Charter Amendment, the Share Issuance and the proposed debt financing.</div>

Goldman Sachs calculated the implied value of such shares of Wabtec common stock by using $83.79 per share, which was the closing trading price per share of Wabtec common stock on April 19, 2018, which was the last closing price prior to media reports about the Transactions (the ‘‘Undisturbed Price’’), and the closing price per share of Wabtec common stock on May 17, 2018 (the ‘‘May 17, 2018 Price’’). The implied EV of GE Transportation, using the Undisturbed Price, was $11.1 billion and the implied EV of GE Transportation, using the May 17, 2018 Price, was $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs then adjusted these implied EV calculations for GE Transportation to take into account the net present value of the tax attributes of the Transactions that would accrue to Wabtec pro forma for the Transactions. Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts and applied an illustrative discount rate of 7.0%, which represented a mid-point between an illustrative cost of debt and an illustrative weighted average cost of capital for Wabtec pro forma for the Transactions, to determine the net present value of these tax attributes. The illustrative implied EV of GE Transportation as adjusted to take into account these tax attributes was $10.0 billion, when using the Undisturbed Price, and $11.1 billion, when using the May 17, 2018 Price. </div>

In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated (using historical trading prices and publicly available financial data) the average over the last five years (‘‘Through the Cycle’’), for Wabtec and the Selected Companies, of the EV/LTM EBITDA, EV/NTM EBITDA and EV/CY+2 EBITDA multiples. The Through the Cycle metrics are intended to present multiples based on normalized EBITDA in view of the cyclical nature of the industry.

Goldman Sachs then added such implied present value of projected dividends per share to such range of implied present values per share to derive a range of implied present values per share of $70.00 to $126.00 (rounded to the nearest dollar). In addition, Goldman Sachs adjusted this range of implied present values per share of Wabtec common stock pro forma for the Transactions as of year-end 2021 to include an illustrative net present value per share attributable to the tax attributes of the Transactions that would accrue to Wabtec pro forma for the Transactions, calculated by using the Forecasts for such attributes and an illustrative discount rate of 7.0%, which represented a mid-point between an illustrative cost of debt and an illustrative weighted average cost of capital for Wabtec pro forma for the Transactions. Goldman Sachs compared this range to the range of implied present values per share of Wabtec common stock pro forma for the Transactions inclusive of the Synergies but not such tax attributes as of year-end 2021. This comparison presented a range of implied present values per share of $102.00 to $132.00 (taking into account both the Synergies and the tax attributes) and $97.00 to $126.00 (taking into account the Synergies, but not the tax attributes), in each case, as rounded to the nearest dollar. </div>

Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Wabtec, GE, GE Transportation or the Transactions. </div>

These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Wabtec, SpinCo, GE, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast. </div>

Goldman Sachs provided advice to Wabtec during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Wabtec or the Wabtec Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transactions. </div>

The actual amount of aggregate fees received by Goldman Sachs and its affiliates in connection with the debt financing for the Transactions will depend on, among other things, the completion date of the Transactions. Wabtec estimates that Goldman Sachs and its affiliates will receive approximately $13 million in fees in the aggregate in connection with the proposed financing.</div>

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 1, 2018, Wabtec engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Transactions. The engagement letter between Wabtec and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of $32 million plus a discretionary fee of up to $4 million, all of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Wabtec has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.</div>

However, the Financial Projections are not a guarantee of future actual performance.

The projections reflect strong orders and the execution of existing backlog over the forecast period. The revenue growth in the outer years is fueled by a North American market recovery, primarily driven by carloading growth. Subsequently, Wabtec management made certain adjustments to these financial projections based on its judgment and experience in the industry to reflect Wabtec management’s alternative perspectives regarding GE Transportation. These changes resulted in the Wabtec Adjusted GE Transportation Financial Projections.</div>

The agreements are intended to secure the employees’ dedication and best efforts toward facilitating the Merger and assisting with the integration of the GE Transportation business with the business of Wabtec after the closing date of the Merger. The incentive payments will vest 50% on the closing date of the Merger and 50% twelve months following the closing date, subject to certain customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on soliciting or hiring GE employees during employment with GE and for 12 months thereafter. The target amount of the incentive payment for participating employees is based on a percentage applied to the sum of the employee’s annual base salary plus annual target bonus, with certain employees eligible for additional amounts if specified transaction or business-related goals are attained. The maximum amount of the incentive payments that may be payable in the aggregate to the executive officers is approximately $9.8 million.</div>

Wabtec is in the process of documenting the terms of Mr. Santana’s employment which are subject to finalization in an employment contract that will be entered into prior to the closing of the Merger. The proposed terms for Mr. Santana include an annual base salary of $1,000,000, a target annual bonus opportunity of 100% of his base salary and maximum annual bonus opportunity of 225% of his base salary. In addition, subject to the approval of Wabtec’s Compensation Committee, Mr. Santana will be granted a one-time award of Wabtec restricted stock with an aggregate grant date fair market value of $2,000,000, subject to annual vesting over a four-year period, and will, subject to the approval of Wabtec’s Compensation Committee, receive annual Wabtec equity incentive awards with an aggregate grant date value of at least approximately $2,000,000. The agreement will also include severance arrangements. </div>

If Mr. Rambaud-Measson’s employment is terminated by Wabtec other than for ‘‘cause,’’ death, or ‘‘disability’’ or by Mr. Rambaud-Measson for ‘‘good reason,’’ in each case as defined in the employment agreement, Mr. Rambaud-Measson will receive severance payments equal to (1) a lump-sum cash payment of two times his then-current annual base salary and two times his target bonus for the year of termination, (2) a payment of the pro rata portion of his annual bonus payable for the year in which he was terminated based on the satisfaction of applicable performance targets and payable in a lump sum at such time as bonuses are paid to other senior executives of Wabtec and (3) a pro rata portion of his Wabtec Performance Units outstanding at the time of his termination that he would have earned if he had remained employed until the end of the applicable performance period, which will be settled in shares of Wabtec common stock at such time (as such awards are generally settled for senior executives of Wabtec). Payments described in clauses (1) through (3) are subject to the execution of a release by Mr. Rambaud-Measson. Assuming Mr. Rambaud-Measson’s employment was terminated by Wabtec other than for cause or by himself for good reason on July 16, 2018, the value of the cash severance payments payable to Mr. Rambaud-Measson would have been $4,050,000, which does not include the value of a pro rata portion of outstanding Wabtec Performance Units because those will vest in full upon the closing of the Merger. See the section entitled ‘‘The Transactions—Interests of Wabtec’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions—Outstanding Stock Awards’’ for a description and quantification of Mr. Rambaud-Measson’s Wabtec Performance Units that will vest in connection with the Merger.</div>

In applying the acquisition method, it is necessary to identify both the accounting acquiree and the accounting acquiror. In a business combination effected through an exchange of equity interests, such as the Merger, the entity that issues the interests (Wabtec, in this case) is generally the acquiring entity. In identifying the acquiring entity in a combination effected through an exchange of equity interests, however, all pertinent facts and circumstances must be considered, including the following:</div>

Approximately $2.9 billion of indebtedness is expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions to fund the Direct Sale. Following the consummation of the Transactions, it is expected that post-Transaction GE Transportation will be owned by Wabtec through SpinCo, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec and will hold the SpinCo Business, and Direct Sale Purchaser, which will also be a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec and will hold the assets, potentially including the equity interests in certain pre-Transaction subsidiaries of GE that compose part of GE Transportation, acquired in the Direct Sale and the liabilities assumed in the Direct Sale. Nevertheless, because of the significant assets and operations represented by GE Transportation, Wabtec expects that following the consummation of the Transaction, SpinCo, Direct Sale Purchaser, and/or other entities through which GE Transportation is owned and operated may be required to become guarantors of the indebtedness of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, the New Wabtec Notes and Wabtec’s existing senior unsecured notes.</div>

In this case and calculated on a fully-diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis, GE and pre-Merger holders of GE common stock will collectively hold 50.1% of the equity ownership and associated voting rights in Wabtec after the consummation of the Transactions (with approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock expected to be held by GE) and 49.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock will be held by pre-Merger Wabtec stockholders. The shares held by GE will be subject to GE’s obligations under (x) the Tax Matters Agreement to sell a number of shares of Wabtec common stock within two years of the Distribution Date (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Tax Matters Agreement’’) and (y) the Shareholders Agreement to sell, subject to limited exceptions, all of the shares of Wabtec common stock GE beneficially owns within three years of the closing date of the Merger and prior thereto, to vote all of such shares in the proportion required under the Shareholders Agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Shareholders Agreement’’).</div>

The Wabtec Board currently consists of 12 directors. In connection with the Transactions, the size of the Wabtec Board will be increased to include three additional directors, each of whom is required to be independent as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE, to be designated as nominees by GE (subject to the nominees being reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Wabtec Board), effective at the time of closing of the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the direction of GE, the GE designees will be assigned among the Wabtec Board’s classes of directors so that one GE designee is appointed to the class of directors that is up for reelection at each of the first three annual meetings of Wabtec stockholders that occurs after the closing of the Merger. Additionally, in certain circumstances (see ‘‘The Merger Agreement – Post-Closing Wabtec Board of Directors and Officers’’), the Wabtec Board will take all actions necessary to include the GE designee up for reelection at the first annual meeting of Wabtec stockholders that occurs after the closing of the Merger as nominee for the Wabtec Board at such annual meeting, to recommend that Wabtec stockholders vote in favor of the GE designee and to support the election of the GE designee at such annual meeting. </div>

Wabtec and GE have each received a request for additional information (‘‘second request’’) from the DOJ. The second request is not an uncommon part of the regulatory review process under the HSR Act in respect of large transactions. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Wabtec and GE have substantially complied with their respective request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by both parties or terminated sooner by the DOJ. Wabtec and GE will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ as it reviews the proposed transaction. In addition to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the parties have agreed to take, make or obtain all material actions by, consents or approvals of, or in respect of or filings with any governmental authority required to permit the consummation of the Merger, including the governmental authorizations to be sought in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa and Ukraine.

In order for holders of SpinCo common stock to own shares of Wabtec common stock representing 50.1% of the shares of Wabtec common stock immediately following the effective time of the Merger on a fully-diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis, Wabtec would have to issue to holders of the outstanding shares of SpinCo common stock representing a number of shares of Wabtec common stock equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 50.1% divided by 49.9%, or 1,004 shares of Wabtec common stock.

Among other things, the Separation Agreement specifies (1) those assets of GE related to GE Transportation that are to be transferred to, and those liabilities of GE related to GE Transportation that are to be assumed by, Direct Sale Purchaser in the Direct Sale and (2) those assets of GE related to GE Transportation that are to be transferred to, and those liabilities of GE related to GE Transportation that are to be assumed by, SpinCo and the SpinCo Transferred Subsidiaries in the Separation, and sets forth when and how these transfers and assumptions will occur. The Separation Agreement also includes procedures for the Internal Reorganization and the Distribution by which GE and SpinCo will become separate and independent companies. The matters addressed by the Separation Agreement include, but are not limited to, the matters described below.</div>

However, if SpinCo, Wabtec, or any of their affiliates takes any of the restricted actions described in the Tax Matters Agreement, including the actions described above, and such action results in tax-related losses to GE, then Wabtec may be required under the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify GE for such losses, without regard to whether Wabtec has obtained such an IRS ruling or unqualified opinion.</div>

The Tax Matters Agreement will require Wabtec to pay certain amounts, capped at a specified total, to GE as and when Wabtec realizes actual cash tax savings on account of such reductions in its tax liability. Wabtec’s obligation to pay such amounts may be accelerated or increased upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including late payments by Wabtec, breaches by Wabtec of its obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement, or the occurrence of an insolvency, a bankruptcy or a similar proceeding, a default under a material lending arrangement, or a related event, in each case, with respect to Wabtec or its affiliates.

In addition, in the event of any such opinion, GE’s and SpinCo’s respective trademark counsel will negotiate in good faith an amendment that modifies the Trademark License Agreement to the extent reasonably necessary to address the legal issue arising out of such third party claim or applicable law or rule, regulation or policy.</div>

In addition, SpinCo will provide GE with certain limited post-Distribution services and facility access.

In most cases, a recipient of a given service under the Transition Services Agreement can terminate the service prior to the applicable expiration date upon advanced notice given to the service provider (which, depending on the service, can be up to six months’ prior notice), provided the recipient pays the additional costs incurred by the provider in connection with the early wind-down of the service. Certain individual services may be extended at no additional premium upon 60 days’ prior written notice by the recipient and the provider will not unreasonably withhold its consent to any such extension requests, however, the total service period (including any extensions) with respect to any service may not extend more than 24 months following the Distribution Date.</div>

If Wabtec’s cash flow from operations is less than it anticipates, or if Wabtec’s cash requirements are more than it expects, Wabtec may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to Wabtec on terms advantageous or acceptable to Wabtec, if at all. If Wabtec incurs additional debt or raises equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of Wabtec common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt or preferred stock also may impose additional and more stringent restrictions on Wabtec’s operations than those to which it is currently subject. If Wabtec raises funds through the issuance of additional equity, Wabtec stockholders’ percentage ownership in Wabtec would be further diluted. If Wabtec is unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect Wabtec’s financial condition. </div>

Wabtec’s ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of Wabtec’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet Wabtec’s debt obligations. Each of the ratings organizations reviews Wabtec’s ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Following the announcement of the Transactions, Moody’s affirmed Wabtec’s current credit ratings with a negative outlook, Standard & Poor’s placed Wabtec’s credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade and Fitch assigned Wabtec a BBB- credit rating with a stable outlook. On September 10, 2018, Standard & Poor’s affirmed Wabtec’s current credit ratings with a negative outlook. Downgrades in Wabtec’s ratings could adversely affect Wabtec’s businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.</div>

These assumptions, however, are only preliminary and will be updated only after the consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, with Wabtec considered the acquirer of GE Transportation. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The pro forma purchase price allocation was based on an estimate of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of GE Transportation. In arriving at the estimated fair values, Wabtec considered the preliminary appraisals of independent consultants which were based on a preliminary and limited review of the assets and liabilities related to GE Transportation to be transferred to, or assumed by, Direct Sale Purchaser, SpinCo and the SpinCo Transferred Subsidiaries in the Transactions. Following the Merger, Wabtec expects to complete the purchase price allocation after considering the fair value of the assets and liabilities of GE Transportation at the level of detail necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocation. The final purchase price allocation may be different than that reflected in the pro forma purchase price allocation presented herein, and this difference may be material.</div>

Because GE’s obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement to repay Wabtec on account of tax benefits that are later disallowed is in respect of the portion of the tax benefits for which Wabtec made payments to GE (and not the incremental tax benefits referenced above), GE’s repayment obligation in such case would not fully compensate Wabtec and its subsidiaries for the loss of all of the intended tax basis increases and other related tax benefits referenced above.

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec expects to issue approximately 98.5 million shares of its common stock in the Merger. Because Wabtec will be a significantly larger company and will have significantly more shares of its common stock outstanding after the consummation of the Transactions and significantly more outstanding indebtedness, an acquisition of Wabtec by a third party may become more expensive for potential acquirors. As a result, some companies may not seek to acquire Wabtec, and the reduction in potential parties that may seek to acquire Wabtec could negatively impact the prices at which Wabtec common stock trades.</div>

In accordance with GAAP, Wabtec management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to Wabtec’s business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets.

The executive officers of Wabtec immediately prior to consummation of the Merger are generally expected to be the executive officers of Wabtec immediately following consummation of the Merger, with Albert J.

To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market Wabtec’s products effectively, Wabtec’s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec relies on several key customers who represent a significant portion of its business. While Wabtec believes its relationships with its customers are generally good, Wabtec’s top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with Wabtec. In addition, many of Wabtec’s customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. As a result, customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. Furthermore, the average service life of certain products in Wabtec’s end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes, which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often. As a result of Wabtec’s dependence on its key customers, Wabtec could experience a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition if it lost any one or more of its key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for Wabtec’s products.</div>

Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power, has historically limited Wabtec’s ability to increase prices. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. If Wabtec’s competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than Wabtec’s products, Wabtec may not be able to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of Wabtec’s markets will not adversely affect Wabtec’s business and its results of operations.</div>

Decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which Wabtec’s customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that Wabtec develops will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors.

There may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that Wabtec cannot yet foresee. Any failure by Wabtec to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by Wabtec’s customers may result in a significant loss of demand for Wabtec’s product and service offerings. In addition, advances in technology may require Wabtec to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and Wabtec’s customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments.</div>

In 2015, the industry’s PTC deadline was extended by three years through December 31, 2018, which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the Department of Transportation if certain parameters are met.

Instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that Wabtec’s products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of Wabtec’s customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in Wabtec’s backlog or request for deferred deliveries of Wabtec’s backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect Wabtec’s cash flows and results of operations.</div>

Wabtec’s global headquarters for the Transit group is located in France, and Wabtec conducts other international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, including in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. As a result, Wabtec is subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on its business as a whole, including:</div>

Wabtec cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. Wabtec’s ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.</div>

Wabtec is also subject to other laws and regulations governing its international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations. Despite Wabtec’s policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect Wabtec from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. Any such improper acts could damage Wabtec’s reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt Wabtec’s business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact Wabtec’s business, results of operations and financial condition. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In addition, Wabtec’s manufacturing operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance and mechanical standards, rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally. Wabtec’s business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of Wabtec’s products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives. Wabtec is unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have, if any, on its business or the industry as a whole. Wabtec cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to Wabtec’s business, results of operations and financial condition.</div>

Wabtec has incurred, and will continue to incur, both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including costs associated with the clean-up and investigation of some of Wabtec’s current and former properties and offsite disposal locations. Wabtec believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to its business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that Wabtec will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on Wabtec’s business and results of operations, including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations, injunctive relief (including requirements that Wabtec limit or cease operations at affected facilities), and reputational risk. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In addition, certain of Wabtec’s products are subject to extensive, and increasingly stringent, statutory and regulatory requirements governing, e.g., emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Union and other regulatory agencies around the world. Wabtec has made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standards—particularly in emerging markets—are unpredictable and subject to change.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for Wabtec that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by Wabtec. Any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to Wabtec’s industry. At this time, Wabtec cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on Wabtec’s operations. Further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require Wabtec to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for Wabtec’s products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that Wabtec uses could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting Wabtec’s suppliers. An increase in the price of Wabtec’s raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect Wabtec’s operating margins or result in reduced demand for Wabtec’s products.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">From time to time, Wabtec is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to its business, customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders, product liability, intellectual property infringement, warranty claims or environmental-related matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, Wabtec cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. Wabtec may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. Any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on Wabtec’s business and results of operations. Although Wabtec maintains insurance policies for certain risks, Wabtec cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect Wabtec from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all.</div>
        <div class="frisk" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 13pt;"><b><i>If Wabtec is not able to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, Wabtec may be adversely </i></b><b><i>affected.</i></b></div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec’s success can be impacted by its ability to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Wabtec relies primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights. However, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on Wabtec’s products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, existing U.S. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide Wabtec with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. The laws of countries other than the United States may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. As a result, a significant portion of Wabtec’s technology is not patented and Wabtec may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. Further, although Wabtec routinely conducts anti-counterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions, Wabtec has encountered counterfeit reproductions of Wabtec’s products or products that otherwise infringe on Wabtec’s intellectual property rights. Counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact Wabtec’s brand value. Accordingly, despite Wabtec’s efforts, Wabtec may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, counterfeiting or misappropriating its intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to Wabtec’s technology. If Wabtec fails to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then Wabtec’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In addition, Wabtec operates in industries in which there are many third-party owners of intellectual property rights. Owners of intellectual property that Wabtec needs to conduct its business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to Wabtec on terms Wabtec considers reasonable. Third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against Wabtec based on their intellectual property portfolios. If Wabtec is sued for intellectual property infringement, Wabtec may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if Wabtec prevails.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and Wabtec’s business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. Wabtec relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage its business. In addition, Wabtec collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business. Cybersecurity attacks could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to Wabtec’s data and computer systems. Attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations. Wabtec employs a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include employee education, password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place and frequent backups; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. A cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of Wabtec’s employees, customers and suppliers, and potentially violate certain domestic and international privacy laws. Furthermore, a cybersecurity attack on Wabtec’s customers and suppliers could compromise Wabtec’s confidential information in the possession of Wabtec’s customers and suppliers. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect Wabtec’s business operations, including through lawsuits by third-parties. In addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec warrants the workmanship and materials of many of its products. Accordingly, Wabtec is subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of its products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to Wabtec’s customers’ specifications. In addition, in recent years, Wabtec has introduced a number of new products for which Wabtec does not have a history of warranty experience. Although Wabtec currently maintains liability insurance coverage, Wabtec cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed Wabtec’s insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to Wabtec’s reputation.</div>

Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which Wabtec operates, Wabtec may not be able to retain, recruit and train the personnel Wabtec requires, particularly when the economy expands, production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec collectively bargains with labor unions at some of its operations throughout the world. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt Wabtec’s operations. Furthermore, non-union employees in certain countries have the right to strike. If Wabtec were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for Wabtec to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. Wabtec cannot assure that it will reach any such agreement or that it will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of Wabtec’s personnel. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on Wabtec’s business, results of operations and financial condition, could cause Wabtec to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on Wabtec’s business.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec purchases energy, steel, aluminum, copper, rubber and rubber-based materials, chemicals, polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources, and traditionally has not had long-term pricing contracts with its pure raw material suppliers. The costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside Wabtec’s control. If Wabtec is unable to pass increases in the costs of Wabtec’s raw materials on to Wabtec’s customers, experiences a lag in its ability to pass increases to Wabtec’s customers, or operational efficiencies are not achieved, Wabtec’s operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Wabtec’s businesses compete globally for key production inputs. In addition, Wabtec relies upon third-party suppliers, including certain single-sourced suppliers, for various components for its products. In the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs, Wabtec may experience challenges sourcing certain of its components to meet its production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs. Any such shortage may materially adversely affect Wabtec’s competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In the ordinary course of business, Wabtec is exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Wabtec is subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that Wabtec’s costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which Wabtec earns and reports revenues and vice versa. In addition, a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce Wabtec’s profits from non-U.S. operations and the translated value of the net assets of Wabtec’s non-U.S. operations when reported in U.S. dollars in Wabtec’s consolidated financial statements. Wabtec may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. Material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to Wabtec. </div>

It cannot be assured that Wabtec will be able to retain all of its current senior management personnel and attract and retain other key personnel necessary for the development of Wabtec’s business. The loss of the services of senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on Wabtec’s business, results of operations and financial condition.</div>

Since 1991, successive Indian governments have generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms, including by significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector. Nevertheless, the role of the Indian central and state governments in the Indian economy as producers, consumers and regulators has remained significant and Wabtec cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investments in India could change as well, including exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other governmental actions.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Further, protests against privatizations and government corruption scandals, which have occurred in the past, could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation.

Any congestion or disruption with respect to communication systems or any public facility, including transportation infrastructure, could disrupt Wabtec’s normal business activity. Any deterioration of India’s physical infrastructure would harm the national economy, disrupt the transportation of people, goods and supplies, and add costs to doing business in India.

Wabtec and the other Borrowers entered into the Credit Agreement on June 8, 2018, which includes (i) a $1.2 billion Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) a $350.0 million Refinancing Term Loan and (iii) a $400.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. Wabtec also obtained Bridge Commitments in respect of the Bridge Loan Facility in an amount not to exceed $2.5 billion. On September 14, 2018, in accordance with the Commitment Letter, the Bridge Commitments were permanently reduced to $0 in connection with Wabtec’s issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. Wabtec will use funds available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the proceeds from the issuance of the New Wabtec Notes to pay the Direct Sale Purchase Price.

Wabtec cannot complete the Merger, and will not complete the Direct Sale, unless the Share Issuance is approved by a majority of votes cast by Wabtec stockholders on the Share Issuance proposal at the special meeting and the Wabtec Charter Amendment is approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock.</div>

Wabtec stockholders should read this information carefully and in its entirety. Copies of the Material Agreements are attached as Annexes A through F to this proxy statement. The special meeting of stockholders will be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, on November 14, 2018 at The Duquesne Club, 325 Sixth Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222. The enclosed voting materials allow Wabtec stockholders to vote their shares without attending the Wabtec special meeting. <i>The vote of Wabtec stockholders is very important and </i><i>Wabtec encourages its stockholders to vote their proxy as soon as possible.

Each share of Wabtec common stock represents one vote. There were 96,614,946 shares of common stock outstanding as of October 11, 2018.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">To conduct the business of the special meeting, there must be a quorum. This means at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock entitled to vote on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. You are considered a part of the quorum if you vote over the Internet, by telephone or by submitting a properly signed proxy card. If you are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Because banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of common stock in ‘‘street name’’ on behalf of beneficial owners do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares held in ‘‘street name’’ with respect to at least one of the proposals means your shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and will not be counted toward determining whether a quorum exists. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Wabtec to additional expense.</div>

You also have the option of voting in person if you attend the special meeting or by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card that accompanied the printed materials. Submitting your vote via the Internet or by telephone or by proxy card will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the special meeting.</div>

An abstention will be treated as a vote cast under NYSE rules and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. In accordance with applicable rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of common stock in ‘‘street name’’ on behalf of beneficial owners do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement. If your shares are held in ‘‘street name’’ and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted. Because only votes cast with respect to Proposal 1 are counted, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares held in ‘‘street name’’ will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1. If Proposal 1 is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed.</div>

In accordance with applicable rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of common stock in ‘‘street name’’ on behalf of beneficial owners do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement. If your shares are held in ‘‘street name’’ and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted. Because the required vote with respect to Proposal 2 is based upon the number of outstanding Wabtec shares and not the number of shares that are actually voted, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares held in ‘‘street name’’ will have the same effect as a vote cast against the Wabtec Charter Amendment. If Proposal 2 is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed.</div>

The acquisition of Faiveley Transport significantly strengthened Wabtec’s capabilities and presence in the worldwide transit market.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The Transit Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically regional trains, high speed trains, subway cars, light-rail vehicles and buses; supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics, positive train control equipment, and signal design and engineering services; builds new commuter locomotives; and refurbishes passenger transit vehicles. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of passenger transit vehicles and buses around the world. Demand in the transit market is primarily driven by general economic conditions, passenger ridership levels, government spending on public transportation, and investment in new rolling stock. The addition of Faiveley Transport’s key products strengthened Wabtec's presence in the following areas: high-speed braking and door systems; heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems; pantographs and power collection; information systems; platform screen doors and gates; couplers; and aftermarket services, maintenance and spare parts. Geographically, Faiveley Transport significantly strengthened Wabtec’s presence in the European and Asia Pacific transit markets.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The Freight Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotives and freight cars; supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics, positive train control equipment, and signal design and engineering services; overhauls locomotives; and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. Demand is primarily driven by general economic conditions and industrial activity; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings; investment in new technologies; and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. </div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation is a leading global provider of products and solutions to transportation, logistics and other industrial markets. GE Transportation designs, engineers and manufactures diesel-electric locomotives, supplies associated aftermarket parts and services and provides digital solutions. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s culture of innovation and differentiated aftermarket solutions has allowed it to build a leading global installed base of diesel-electric locomotives, significant contracted services backlog and longstanding customer relationships. GE Transportation’s products and services, which are globally recognized for their quality, reliability, fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, are important to GE Transportation’s customers’ operating and financial success and help enable them to operate with reliability and efficiency. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Leveraging GE Transportation’s engineering history and heritage in diesel-electric locomotives, GE Transportation has continued to expand its technologies into new products, end markets and logistics applications. For example, GE Transportation uses its core locomotive manufacturing competencies to produce electric motors and premium propulsion systems for mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. GE Transportation also has used its engineering and software capabilities to build a digital business that delivers significant benefits across the transportation, logistics and mining landscape. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">These attributes combined have fostered strong brand loyalty and generated longstanding customer relationships, which contribute to GE Transportation’s leading market positions. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">As of December 31, 2017, GE Transportation’s North American installed base was more than 16,200 diesel-electric locomotives and kits, comprising the largest portion of GE Transportation’s global installed base of more than 22,500 diesel-electric locomotives. As of December 31, 2017, GE Transportation had sales in more than 50 countries and eight primary manufacturing facilities and approximately 8,500 employees worldwide. For the year ended December 31, 2017, GE Transportation generated revenue of $3,930 million and net earnings of $374 million.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">For over 110 years, GE Transportation has served the worldwide rail industry, which is a critical component of the global transportation system and the global economy. In North America, railroads carry approximately 28% of total freight, as measured by ton-miles, and over 40% of long distance freight travelling over 750 miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. Rail is one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient modes of transport, both domestically and internationally. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s North American customers are principally Class I railroads. GE Transportation’s international customers are principally international freight railroads in Latin America, Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Australia, India and Sub-Saharan Africa, who depend on diesel-electric locomotives. GE Transportation’s diverse product portfolio is designed to cater to the varying requirements of Class I and international railroads. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s customers’ ongoing usage of locomotives and associated wear and tear on the equipment generate opportunities to support railroads with aftermarket parts and services. Railroads place a high value on reliability, fuel efficiency and minimal downtime. As a result, the availability of replacement parts and GE Transportation’s maintenance and overhaul services are important value drivers for GE Transportation’s customers and generate high-margin recurring revenue opportunities.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s business experienced significant headwinds in 2016 and 2017 due to a downturn in the U.S. freight rail industry. GE Transportation has recently undergone a set of transformation and restructuring initiatives, including expanding GE Transportation’s international footprint, optimizing GE Transportation’s supply base and utilizing digitization and lean manufacturing to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of GE Transportation’s total supply chain. GE Transportation believes these initiatives have resulted in a more streamlined cost structure and optimized workforce to position GE Transportation for growth in the recovering U.S. freight rail market and in international markets. </div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s Equipment segment is the largest global manufacturer of diesel-electric locomotives for freight railroads. GE Transportation produces mission-critical products and solutions that help railroads reduce operating costs, decrease fuel use, minimize downtime and comply with emissions standards. In addition to locomotives, GE Transportation also produces a range of engines, electric motors and premium propulsion systems used in mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. </div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation believes it has the world’s most comprehensive, competitive and technically advanced diesel-electric locomotive portfolio with a global installed base of more than 22,500 locomotives in over 50 countries. GE Transportation also has numerous local partnerships in various jurisdictions which further support its product platform. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Customers choose diesel-electric locomotives based on many factors, including fuel efficiency, emissions compliance, reliability, tractive effort, price, total cost of ownership, aftermarket support and digital capabilities. GE Transportation believes customers are also trending towards signing multiyear equipment and service / parts agreements. For example, GE Transportation recently signed an agreement with Kazakhstan’s state-run railroad, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ), to supply 300 shunter locomotives over the next ten years and agreements with Canadian National Railway (CN) for 200 new locomotives and Kansas City Southern for 50 locomotives. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s current locomotive offerings include 24 different types of locomotives of varying features and capabilities such as axle weight, clearance and gross horsepower. GE Transportation believes the Evolution series, GE Transportation’s primary locomotive offering, is the most technologically advanced, diesel-electric, heavy-haul locomotive in the world today. GE Transportation introduced the base Evolution series in 2005 and has since substantively evolved the locomotive to meet EPA Tier 4 emission standards. GE Transportation now has over 870 Tier 4 locomotives in the field with over 100-million miles of experience. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s sales, product management and engineering teams work together with its customers to optimize configurations for their requirements related to performance, reliability, lifecycle costs and other additions (e.g., Digital, signaling, etc.) that they may specifically require for their locomotive. However, GE Transportation strives to standardize its offerings as much as possible. For example, the engine family used in North America for the 33-tonnes/axle application is used in both Kazakhstan for the 23-tonnes/axle application and in South Africa for the 22-tonnes/axle application. Similarly, GE Transportation’s new control systems and traction motors have been standardized across a significant portion of GE Transportation’s portfolio.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">New technologies will continue to evolve the diesel-electric space. GE Transportation continues to invest substantively and selectively in R&D to maintain its differentiation and market position. One key focus of GE Transportation’s investments is control systems, which GE Transportation believes enable and support remote monitoring, predictive maintenance and asset optimization as well as connectivity between fleets and operations. Additionally, GE Transportation’s investments are generally focused on new engine platforms, fuel efficiency, alternative fuel solutions and hybrid locomotives. Finally, GE Transportation believes GE Transportation’s </div>

Operators strive to maximize the value of their assets over their entire lifecycle, which can be as many as four decades. For locomotives to remain competitive, available, reliable, safe and fuel efficient over such a long period, they require regular maintenance as well as technology upgrades. Operators also often need to adjust fleet haulage profiles to reflect changing market conditions (e.g., moving from build materials to containerized intermodal freight). These requirements translate into significant investments by railroads throughout the entire lifecycle of their locomotives.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation has been strategically focused on the Services segment for more than two decades, providing an efficient supply of spare parts, repair instructions, on-site technical support by certified employees and predictive maintenance based on GE Transportation’s suite of remote monitoring and diagnostics solutions.

GE Transportation’s market shares are typically higher in North America and lower in other regions of the world, depending on specific product lines and geographies. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation operates in a highly competitive marketplace especially in periods of low market demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity. Price competition is strong because GE Transportation has a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The industries in which GE Transportation operate are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental, regulatory and industry authorities and by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the issuance of regulations and standards for the rail industry in the U.S. are the Federal Railroad Administration (‘‘FRA’’), the Association of American Railroads (‘‘AAR’’) and U.S. Department of Transportation (‘‘USDOT’’). The FRA administers and enforces U.S. Federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for railcars and rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of standards governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the U.S. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. Because of these regulations, GE Transportation must maintain certifications with the AAR as a manufacturer of locomotives and components, and products that it sells must meet AAR and FRA standards. GE Transportation must also comply with the rules of the USDOT.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation is also subject to oversight in other jurisdictions by foreign regulatory agencies. The governing bodies include Transport Canada in Canada, the International Union of Railways (‘‘UIC’’) and the European Railway Agencies (‘‘EUAR’’) in Europe. Also in Europe, the European Committees for Standardization (‘‘CEN’’ and ‘‘CENELEC’’) continually draft new European standards which cover, for example, the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety of railways systems. To guarantee interoperability in Europe, the European Union for Railway Agencies is responsible for defining and implementing Technical Standards of Interoperability, which covers areas such as infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, telematic applications, traffic operation and management subsystems, noise pollution and waste generation, protection against fire and smoke, and system safety. Most countries and regions in which GE Transportation does business have similar rule-making bodies. In Russia, a GOST-R certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals on Russian territory. In China, any product or system sold on the Chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards. In the local Indian market, most products are covered by regulations patterned after AAR and UIC standards.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s business is not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of its major customers during this period. Quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation is subject to comprehensive federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations not only exposes GE Transportation to liability for its own negligent acts, but also may expose GE Transportation to liability for the conduct of others or for its actions that complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. GE Transportation’s operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under the common law.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for GE Transportation’s operations under environmental laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. GE Transportation regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of GE Transportation’s business, as it is with other businesses engaged in similar industries. GE Transportation believes that its operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on GE Transportation’s financial condition and operations. In addition, GE Transportation has in the past conducted investigation and remediation activities at properties that GE Transportation operates to address historic contamination. To date, such costs have not been material. Although GE Transportation believes GE Transportation has satisfactorily addressed all known material contamination through its remediation activities, there can be no assurance that these activities have addressed all historic contamination. The discovery of historic contamination or the release of hazardous substances into the environment could require GE Transportation in the future to incur investigation or remediation costs or other liabilities that could be material or that could interfere with the operation of GE Transportation’s business. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In addition to environmental laws and regulations, the transportation of commodities by railcar raises potential risks in the event of a derailment or other accident. Generally, liability under existing law in the United States for a derailment or other accident depends on the negligence of the party, such as the railroad, the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components. However, for the shipment of certain hazardous commodities, strict liability concepts may apply.</div>

GE Transportation’s products and services are important to GE Transportation’s customers’ operating and financial success and help enable them to operate with reliability and efficiency. Leveraging its heritage in diesel-electric locomotives, GE Transportation has continued to expand GE Transportation’s technologies into new products, end markets and logistics applications. Leveraging its core competencies in locomotive manufacturing, GE Transportation produces electric motors and premium propulsion systems for mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. GE Transportation also has used its engineering and software capabilities to build a digital business that delivers significant benefits across the transportation and mining landscape. GE Transportation’s products are globally recognized for their quality, reliability, fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, and GE Transportation believes it is known for its superior customer service. These attributes combined have fostered strong brand loyalty and generated longstanding customer relationships, which contribute to its leading market positions. As of June 30, 2018, GE Transportation’s North American installed base was more than 16,200 diesel-electric locomotives and kits, comprising the largest portion of GE Transportation’s global installed base of more than 22,500 diesel-electric locomotives and kits. As of June 30, 2018, GE Transportation had sales in more than 50 countries and eight primary manufacturing facilities and approximately 8,500 employees worldwide. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, GE Transportation generated revenue of $1,774 million and net earnings of $168 million.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">For over 110 years, GE Transportation has served the worldwide freight and passenger rail industries, which are a critical component of the global transportation system and the global economy. In North America, railroads carry about 28% of total freight, as measured by ton-miles, and over 40% of long distance freight travelling over 750 miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. Rail is one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient modes of transport, both domestically and internationally. GE Transportation’s North American customers are principally Class I railroads. GE Transportation’s international customers are principally international freight and passenger railroads in Latin America, Russia/CIS, Australia, India and Sub-Saharan Africa, who depend on diesel-electric locomotives. GE Transportation’s diverse product portfolio is designed to cater to the varying requirements of Class I and international railroads. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s customers’ ongoing usage of locomotives and associated wear and tear on the equipment generate opportunities to support railroads with aftermarket parts and services. Railroads place a high value on reliability, fuel efficiency and minimal downtime. As a result, the availability of replacement parts and GE Transportation’s maintenance and overhaul services are important value drivers for GE Transportation’s customers and generate high-margin recurring revenue opportunities. </div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation’s business experienced significant headwinds in 2016 and 2017 due to a downturn in the U.S. freight rail industry driven by commodity prices. GE Transportation has recently undergone a set of transformation and restructuring initiatives, including expanding its international footprint, optimizing its supply base and utilizing digitization and lean manufacturing to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its total supply chain. GE Transportation believes these initiatives have resulted in a more streamlined cost structure and optimized workforce to position it for growth in the recovering U.S. freight rail market and in international markets. </div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries. As such, its operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world, and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies. In general, trends such as increasing urbanization, a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness, an aging equipment fleet, and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. Freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity, while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership. Changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for GE Transportation's products and services.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">According to the 2016 edition of a market study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than $100 billion, and was expected to grow at about 3.2% annually through 2021. The three largest geographic markets, which represented about 80% of the total accessible market, were Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. UNIFE projected above-average growth in Asia Pacific and Europe due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility, deregulation, investments in new technologies, energy and environmental issues, and increasing government support. The largest product segments of the market were rolling stock, services and infrastructure, which represented almost 90% of the accessible market. UNIFE projected spending on rolling stock to grow at an above-average rate due to increased investment in passenger transit vehicles. UNIFE estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114,000 units, with about 32% in Asia Pacific, about 25% in North America and about 18% in Russia/CIS. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In North America, railroads carry about 40% of long distance freight travelling over 750 miles, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as ‘‘Class I,’’ accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. The railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, including coal, metals, minerals, chemicals, grain, and petroleum. These commodities represent about 50% of total rail carloadings, with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry and the emergence of autonomous trucks, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by GE Transportation and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits. Demand for GE Transportation’s locomotives, freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including rail traffic, average railroad velocity and production of new locomotives and new freight cars. In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including government funding, deliveries of new subway cars and buses, and ridership. The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems. Demand for GE Transportation’s services is affected by the number of parked locomotives, which hit historic highs in 2016 and has slightly recovered in 2017. </div>

India is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system; for example, the country has awarded a 1,000-unit locomotive order to GE Transportation. UNIFE expected the increased spending in India to offset decreased spending on very-high-speed rolling stock in China.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Other key geographic markets include Russia/CIS and Africa-Middle East. With about 1.4 million freight cars and about 28,000 locomotives, Russia/CIS is among the largest freight rail markets in the world, and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock. PRASA, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives. According to UNIFE, emerging markets were expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, GE Transportation expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services to both new customers and the installed base in these markets.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In its study, UNIFE also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management, and in rail control technologies, both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry. UNIFE said data-driven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization, while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity, improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic. GE Transportation offers integrated solutions to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In 2018 and beyond, general global economic and market conditions will have an impact on GE Transportation’s sales and operations. To the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets amid a rising interest rate environment, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market GE Transportation’s products effectively with a higher cost of capital, GE Transportation’s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, GE Transportation faces risks inherent in global expansion and risk associated with its four-point growth strategy, including the level of investment in innovation that customers are willing to make, especially in integrated technologies developed by the industry and GE Transportation. When necessary, GE Transportation will modify its financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 6pt;">The effective income tax rate was 21% and 36% in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The rate for 2018 benefited from a lower U.S. statutory rate effective for years beginning in 2018 due to U.S. tax reform and favorable changes in mix of earnings. GE Transportation’s operating results are included in the consolidated income tax returns of GE where allowable. The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and non-U.S. taxes on income calculated on a separate tax return basis. As a separate stand-alone company, GE Transportation’s tax profile may differ from historical results.</div>

Contractual services were down 11%, primarily driven by lower volume on existing long term maintenance contracts attributable to lower asset utilization by North American customers reducing the need for spare parts and maintenance. Though carload volumes improved slightly in 2017 and the number of parked locomotives declined, parking still remained near historically high levels and the environment for sales of services remained challenging. The decline in sales of services was partly offset by continued sales to the international installed base, as well as aftermarket digital product sales, which continued to see growth. </div>

The increase was driven primarily by improved earnings before income taxes which was up $55,227 thousand as well as improved working capital management. Earnings before income taxes increased due to improvements in gross profit and lower benefit costs. Changes in working capital were primarily attributable to an increase in progress collections due to deposits received on new orders. This was partially offset by an increase in contract assets as GE Transportation recognized more revenue than invoiced, and an increase in accounts receivable due to lower utilization of the receivable factoring program. </div>

These activities expose GE Transportation to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which can adversely affect revenues earned and costs of its operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. GE Transportation uses derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.

Contract modifications that extend or revise contract terms are not uncommon and generally result in GE Transportation’s recognizing the impact of the revised terms prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract (i.e., effectively like a new contract). GE Transportation’s revenue recognition on CSAs requires estimates of both customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs expected to be incurred to perform required maintenance services.

Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature of the timing and extent of GE Transportation’s underlying performance activities as GE Transportation’s stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at pre-determined usage intervals. Customers generally pay GE Transportation based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. Changes in customer utilization can influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">As a result, the revenue recognized each period is dependent on GE Transportation’s estimate of how a customer will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. GE Transportation generally uses a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing GE Transportation’s revenue estimates. This estimate of customer utilization will </div>

In developing GE Transportation’s cost estimates, GE Transportation utilizes a combination of GE Transportation’s historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation regularly assesses customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset GE Transportation’s accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. GE Transportation gains insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through GE Transportation’s knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with GE Transportation’s customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset’s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. GE Transportation derives the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from GE Transportation’s historical experience and GE Transportation’s internal business plans. To determine fair value, GE Transportation uses quoted market prices when available, GE Transportation’s internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation tests goodwill for impairment annually each year. The impairment test consists of two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step two, which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. GE Transportation determines fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. GE Transportation assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time GE Transportation performs the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to GE Transportation’s businesses.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. GE Transportation uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on GE Transportation’s most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. Actual results may differ from those assumed in GE Transportation’s forecasts.

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, <i>Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the </i><i>Test for Goodwill.</i> This ASU simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment to a single-step test. The guidance removes step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation, and will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under the revised guidance, failing step one will always result in goodwill impairment. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. GE Transportation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-04 on GE Transportation’s combined financial statements.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, <i>Financial Instruments-Credit Losses:</i> Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU introduces a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models under current U.S. GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The new standard will also apply to receivables arising from revenue transactions such as contract assets and accounts receivables and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. GE Transportation continues to evaluate the effect of the standard on GE Transportation’s combined financial statements. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, <i>Leases</i> (ASU 2016-02), creating ASC Subtopic 842, <i>Leases</i>. ASU 2016-02 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged compared to the current accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for the interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. GE Transportation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on GE Transportation’s combined financial statements.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 7pt;">The Pro Forma Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Wabtec as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are incorporated by reference herein from Wabtec’s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 10, 2018, Wabtec’s interim financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, which are incorporated by reference herein from Wabtec’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and the audited combined financial statements of GE Transportation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and GE Transportation’s interim financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, which are, in each case, included elsewhere in this proxy statement. GE Transportation’s historical financial statements included in this proxy statement have been presented on a ‘‘carve-out’’ basis from GE’s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities of GE Transportation and include allocations of corporate expenses from GE. These allocations reflect significant assumptions, and the financial statements do not fully reflect what GE Transportation’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had it been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. As a result, historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of GE Transportation’s future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The note disclosure requirements of annual consolidated financial statements provide additional disclosures to that required for pro forma condensed combined financial information. </div>

In connection with the Separation of GE Transportation from the remaining business of GE, GE will conduct the Internal Reorganization. The Transactions have been approved by the Wabtec Board and the GE Board.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In connection with the Direct Sale, certain assets of GE Transportation, potentially including the equity interests of certain pre-Transaction subsidiaries of GE that compose part of GE Transportation, will be sold to Direct Sale Purchaser for a cash payment of $2.9 billion, and Direct Sale Purchaser will assume certain liabilities of GE Transportation in connection with this purchase. Thereafter, GE will transfer the SpinCo Business to SpinCo and its subsidiaries (to the extent not already held by SpinCo and its subsidiaries) in the SpinCo Transfer, and SpinCo will issue to GE additional shares of SpinCo common stock in the SpinCo Transfer. Following this issuance of additional SpinCo common stock to GE, GE will own 8,700,000,000 shares of SpinCo common stock, or such other amount as GE determines, subject to the consent of Wabtec not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, which will constitute all of the outstanding SpinCo common stock. </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Following the Direct Sale and based on market conditions, corporate finance considerations and timing considerations, GE will distribute the Distribution Shares of SpinCo in a spin-off or a split-off transaction. Immediately after the Distribution and on the closing date of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into SpinCo, whereby the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and SpinCo will continue as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec. In the Merger, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of SpinCo common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Wabtec common stock based on the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.’’ </div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Upon consummation of the Merger and calculated based on Wabtec’s outstanding common stock immediately prior to the Merger on a fully-diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis, 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock would be held collectively by GE and pre-Merger holders of GE common stock (with approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock expected to be held by GE) and 49.9% of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock would be held by pre-Merger Wabtec stockholders. The shares held by GE will be subject to GE’s obligations under (x) the Tax Matters Agreement to sell a number of shares of Wabtec common stock within two years of the Distribution Date (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Tax Matters Agreement’’) and (y) the Shareholders Agreement to sell, subject to limited exceptions, all of the shares of Wabtec common stock GE beneficially owns within three years of the closing date of the Merger and prior thereto, to vote all of such shares in the proportion required under the Shareholders Agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘‘Other Agreements—Shareholders Agreement’’). GE has the right to increase the percentage of the outstanding shares of Wabtec common stock to be held by pre-Merger GE stockholders (subject to a corresponding reduction in the percentage held by GE).</div>

Using Wabtec’s closing stock price on the NYSE as of August 17, 2018, the total value of the consideration for the Transactions would be approximately $14.2 billion, including the Direct Sale Purchase Price, contingent consideration, assumed debt and net of cash acquired.

Wabtec has not completed the final valuation necessary to determine the acquisition date fair market value of GE Transportation’s net assets. As more information becomes available, Wabtec will complete a more detailed review of the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to reflect the acquisition date fair value of those assets and liabilities. As a result of that review, more information could become available that, when analyzed, could have a material impact on the Pro Forma Statements.</div>

Estimated remaining transaction costs for Wabtec and GE Transportation have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income on the basis that these expenses are directly related to the Transactions but are nonrecurring in nature. Total estimated transaction costs for Wabtec and GE Transportation are approximately $100 million. Certain of GE Transportation’s transaction costs will be borne by GE. </div>

This amount is excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income because it does not have a continuing impact on operations. At this point in time Wabtec is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the total compensation expense related to the merger; therefore, no adjustment has been recorded to retained earnings in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.</div>

Based upon the reported closing sale price of $109.97 per share for Wabtec common stock on the NYSE on August 17, 2018, the total value of the shares of Wabtec common stock to be issued by Wabtec in the Merger would be approximately $10.8 billion, and the cash to be received by GE in the Transactions, including in respect of the Direct Sale, would be approximately $2.9 billion plus any payments GE receives pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement. The actual value of the Wabtec common stock to be issued in the Merger will depend on the market price of shares of Wabtec common stock at the time of the Merger. In the Merger, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of SpinCo common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Wabtec common stock based on the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. </div>

The aggregate number of shares of Wabtec common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will exceed 20% of the shares of Wabtec common stock outstanding before such issuance.

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">We have audited the accompanying combined statement of financial position of GE Transportation (a carve-out business of General Electric Company) (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related combined statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the combined financial statements). In our opinion, the combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</div>

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</div>

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">GE Transportation (the ‘‘Business’’, ‘‘GET’’, ‘‘our’’ or ‘‘we’’) is a carve-out business of General Electric Company (‘‘GE’’ or ‘‘Parent’’). We are a leading global provider of products and solutions to transportation, logistics and other industrial markets. We design, engineer and manufacture diesel-electric locomotives, supply associated aftermarket parts and services and provide digital solutions. Our culture of innovation and differentiated aftermarket solutions has allowed us to build a leading global installed base of diesel-electric locomotives, significant contracted services backlog and longstanding customer relationships. Our products and services are critical to our customers’ operating and financial success and enable them to operate with reliability and efficiency. Leveraging our heritage in diesel-electric locomotives, we have continued to innovate to expand our technologies into new products, end markets and logistics applications. Leveraging our core competencies in locomotive manufacturing, we produce electric motors and premium propulsion systems for mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. We have combined industry leadership with engineering and software capabilities to build a digital business that is leading the transformation of the transportation and mining industries. We employ approximately 9,000 employees and serve customers across approximately 60 countries.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The Business is comprised of three reportable segments, which reflect the way performance is assessed and resources are allocated.</div>

We produce mission-critical products and solutions that help railroads reduce operating costs, decrease fuel use, minimize downtime and comply with stringent emissions standards. In addition to locomotives, we also produce a range of engines, electric motors and premium propulsion systems used in mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. This segment represents approximately 45%, 53% and 59% of annual revenues in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</div>

We provide aftermarket parts and services to our global installed base, including predictive maintenance, regular maintenance, and unscheduled maintenance and overhaul services for locomotives. Our offerings include supply of parts, technical support and locomotive modernizations. Commercially, locomotive maintenance can be contracted on a fully transactional basis or through multi-year contracts (Contractual Service Agreements or ‘‘CSAs’’), where we assume certain service activities, and the related performance risks, in return for fixed and variable payments based on underlying utilization of the asset(s) covered. This segment represents approximately 48%, 41% and 37% of annual revenues in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</div>

These combined financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented as carve-out financial statements and reflect the combined historical results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows of the Business, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’).

Net parent investment represents GE’s historical investment in the Business and includes accumulated net earnings attributable to GE, the net effect of transactions with GE and GE entities, and cost allocations from GE that were not historically allocated to the Business.</div>

These arrangements are not reflective of the manner in which the Business would have financed its operations had it been a stand-alone business separate from GE during the periods presented. Cash pooling arrangements are excluded from the asset and liability balances in the Combined Statement of Financial Position. These amounts have instead been reported as Net parent investment as a component of equity.</div>

The Business may also sell products in the ordinary course of business to GE and its affiliates. The Combined Statement of Earnings includes expense allocations for services and certain support functions (‘‘GE Corporate Overhead’’) that are provided on a centralized basis within GE such as legal, business development, human resources, corporate audit, treasury and various other GE corporate functions that are routinely allocated to the Business and reflected in the Combined Statement of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to GE Corporate Overhead allocations, Selling, general and administrative expenses that would have been incurred in the ordinary course of business if the Business operated as a stand-alone company, such as compensation and benefits for employees of the Business, were included based on either specific identification of direct expenses or an allocation using an approach related to the nature of the item (e.g., external revenue or headcount).</div>

We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While the Business believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these combined financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: estimates of variable revenues and/or costs on long-term revenue generating contracts, recoverability of long-lived assets and inventory, valuation of goodwill, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and related valuation allowances, accruals for contingencies including warranties, actuarial assumptions used to determine costs on employee benefit plans, valuation assumptions for long term stock-based compensation expense, valuation and recoverability of receivables, valuation of derivatives and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions.</div>

We routinely review estimates under CSAs and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook, however these estimates may materially vary from actual payments and costs incurred over the life of the contracts.</div>

The Business maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including the payment history and financial condition of our debtors and the economic environment. In addition, we consider current receivables aging, unless a specific reserve is established when customers are in bankruptcy or involved in legal disputes about amounts owed. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, three customers each accounted for more than 10% of our combined revenues Additionally, two customers accounted for approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of gross customer receivables as of December 31, 2017 and one customer accounted for approximately 24% of gross customer receivables as of December 31, 2016. Although this concentration affects our overall exposure to credit risk, our customer receivables are spread over a diverse group of customers across many countries, which mitigates this risk. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions, including monitoring our customers’ payment history and current credit worthiness to manage this risk. We do not generally require collateral in support of our customer receivables, but we may require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or a bank guarantee. Our customer receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the wide variety of customers and markets into which our equipment and services are sold and their dispersion across geographic regions.

If those four conditions are not met, the employer should account for postemployment benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, and the Business tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently when facts or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below that operating segment (the component level), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Business also tests goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Business uses quantitative assessment or qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Business chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a further quantitative fair value test is performed. The Business recognizes an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill based on the results of our quantitative tests. The market and income approach are used for estimating the fair values for our reporting units. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.</div>

In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.</div>

Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset's residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. The required undiscounted cash flow estimates are derived from our historical experience and our internal business plans. To determine fair value, the Business uses quoted market prices when available, our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate, or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Fair values of long-lived assets are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets. These assets are generally included in Level 3. See Note 18 Restructuring and Other activities for impairments recognized related to long-lived assets.</div>

The Business determines its current and deferred taxes based on the separate return method (i.e., as if the Business were a taxpayer separate from GE). All income taxes due to or due from the Business’s Parent that have not been settled or recovered by the end of the period are reflected in Note 13 Income Taxes as such balances will be maintained and settled. Any differences between actual amounts paid or received by the Business and taxes accrued under the separate return method have been reflected in Net parent investment.</div>

Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. The Business currently intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries with operations outside the U.S. and, accordingly, has not provided U.S. income tax on such earnings. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized.</div>

The Business recognizes uncertain tax positions that are ‘‘more likely than not’’ to be sustained if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, the Business measures the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that the Business has a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. The Business classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as interest expense and provision for income taxes, respectively, on the Combined Statement of Earnings.

Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Business. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. At December 31, 2017, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of U.S. tax reform, but will reassess this during the course of 2018; accordingly, we have not provided income tax on such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.</div>

Because aspects of the new minimum tax and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting rules associated with this provision have not been resolved, we have not made a provisional accrual for the deferred tax aspects of this provision and consequently have not made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment of this tax.</div>

The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models in current GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The new standard will also apply to receivables arising from revenue transactions such as contract assets and accounts receivables and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

Non-complex products principally result in each completed product being a separate performance obligation recognized at a point in time. Complex products or services principally result in a single performance obligation as our customer is either procuring a bundled offering that is managed or utilized on a combined basis (e.g., software development solutions in our digital business) or there are multiple complex goods or services in the contract, which are substantially the same and recognized over time (e.g., CSAs or certain highly customized locomotives).

The debt carried a 5.07% interest rate, paid annually for the first year, with the interest rate resetting on the anniversary of the loan to the mid-rate of the one year swap rate plus a credit spread of 200 basis points. In November 2015, the Business extended both agreements by five years from the day of signing to a maturity date in November 2020 and amended the interest rate to the mid-rate of the one year swap rate plus a credit spread of 175 basis points. In May and November 2017, the Business terminated both loans early utilizing cash pool resources. Interest included in interest expense for long-term borrowings, including the current portion, is $2,377 thousand, $5,950 thousand and $8,043 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense is included within Other (expense) income in the Combined Statement of Earnings.</div>

The loan has a total value of $68,703 thousand, disbursed in three tranches. As of December 31, 2017 the first two tranches had been disbursed with a total value of $44,256 thousand. The final tranche will be disbursed in January 2018. The loan carries an 8% annual interest rate, paid quarterly until the maturity of the loan in January 2020. Interest included in interest expense for long-term borrowings, including the current portion, is $588 thousand, $0 thousand and $0 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s intentions concerning the future operations of the Business. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations, and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations. In addition, as a result of U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax, and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. As of December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is approximately $278,956 thousand. Computation of any deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.</div>

The impact of U.S. tax reform has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings. Future guidance could impact the information required for and the calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decisions on timing of various U.S. and foreign items which would further impact the final 2017 amounts included in the transition charge and the revaluation of deferred taxes. In addition, analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for tax reform could affect the provisional estimate.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The U.S. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (‘‘global intangible low-taxed income’’). Because we have tangible assets outside the U.S. and pay a rate of foreign tax above the minimum tax rate, we are not expecting a significant increase in tax liability from this new U.S. minimum tax. Because aspects of the new law and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting rules associated with these taxes have not been resolved, our deferred tax may be affected by these or other newly enacted provisions of U.S. law. Pending further accounting guidance and analysis, we have not made a provisional accrual for the deferred tax effects of the tax on base eroding payments and the tax on global intangible low-taxed income.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Included in 2017 is a tax charge of $5,454 thousand for the provisional estimate associated with the transition tax on historic foreign earnings under U.S. Tax Reform. Also, included in 2017 is a tax benefit of $114,168 thousand for the provisional estimate associated with the U.S. tax rate change. We expect to finalize these amount during 2018 as additional guidance is released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and as we make final decisions and computations based on that guidance. In addition, there may be additional guidance during 2018 on the tax on base erosion payments and the tax on global intangible lower-taxed income. As these amounts are updated and analysis and conclusions to be performed as part of the U.S. tax return process are completed, the effect of revaluation of deferred taxes will also be finalized.</div>

Issuance of a product warranty constitutes a commitment, which must be accrued as a loss contingency if expenditures under the warranty are both probable and reasonably estimable. The Business provides for estimated product warranty expenses when the related product sale is recognized. Additionally, we may elect certain corrective actions, at our expense, for certain product-related matters impacting our product portfolios. Warranty obligations are recognized for these matters when we commit to these corrective actions and they are estimable. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily based on historical warranty claims experience and outstanding warranty period, claims costs may differ from amounts provided.</div>

The Business believes the likelihood is remote that any such arrangements could have a significant adverse effect on these combined financial statements of the Business. The Business records liabilities for guarantees at estimated fair value, generally the amount of the premium received, or if we do not receive a premium, the amount based on appraisal, observed market values or discounted cash flows, which are zero as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Business has off-balance sheet credit exposure through standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, bid bonds, and surety bonds. See Note 11 Borrowings. In addition, our Parent may provide the Business with parent company guarantees in certain jurisdictions where we lack the legal structure to issue the requisite guarantees required on certain projects.

        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Suzch contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, a liability is recorded in the amount of GE Transportation’s best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss, with respect to a contingency, is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure is provided.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. GE Transportation regularly reviews all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss, or range of loss, can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with, or decisions by, third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.</div>

We are a leading global provider of products and solutions to transportation, logistics and other industrial markets. We design, engineer and manufacture diesel-electric locomotives, supply associated aftermarket parts and services, and provide digital solutions. Our culture of innovation and differentiated aftermarket solutions has allowed us to build a leading global installed base of diesel-electric locomotives, significant contracted services backlog and longstanding customer relationships. Our products and services are critical to our customers’ operating and financial success and enable them to operate with reliability and efficiency. Leveraging our heritage in diesel-electric locomotives, we have continued to innovate to expand our technologies into new products, end markets and logistics applications. Leveraging our core competencies in locomotive manufacturing, we produce electric motors and premium propulsion systems for mining, marine, stationary power and drilling applications. We have combined industry leadership with engineering and software capabilities to build a digital business that is leading the transformation of the transportation and mining industries. We employ approximately 9,000 employees and serve customers across approximately 60 countries.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The Business is comprised of three reportable segments, which reflect the way performance is assessed and resources are allocated. These reportable segments are Equipment, Services, and Digital.</div>

The Business may also sell products in the ordinary course of business to GE and its affiliates. The Condensed Combined Statement of Earnings includes expense allocations for services and certain support functions (‘‘GE Corporate Overhead’’) that are provided on a centralized basis within GE such as legal, business development, human resources, corporate audit, treasury and various other GE corporate functions that are routinely allocated to the Business and reflected in the Condensed Combined Statement of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to GE Corporate Overhead allocations, Selling, general and administrative expenses that would have been incurred in the ordinary course of business if the Business operated as a stand-alone company, such as compensation and benefits for employees of the Business, were included based on either specific identification of direct expenses or an allocation using an approach related to the nature of the item (e.g., external revenue or headcount).</div>

We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While the Business believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these condensed combined financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.</div>

As a result, the tax expense from the intercompany sale of assets, other than inventory, and associated changes to deferred taxes will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the pre-tax effects of the transaction have not been recognized. The pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an annual period for which no financial statements have already been issued.

The guidance removes step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation, and will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under the revised guidance, failing step one will always result in goodwill impairment. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Business is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-04 on our combined financial statements.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, <i>Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit </i><i>Losses on Financial Instruments.</i> The ASU introduces a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models under current U.S. GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The new standard will also apply to receivables arising from revenue transactions such as contract assets and accounts receivables and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our combined financial statements.</div>

ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged compared to the current accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for the interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.

Some of these services are provided directly by GE, and others are managed by GE through third-party service providers. The cost of certain of these services is either (a) recognized through our allocated portion of GE’s Corporate Overhead, or (b) billed directly to the Business (such as most of our employee benefit costs). The cost of other services is included within the service itself, and the incremental cost for GE to provide the service is not discernible (such as payroll processing services included within the cost of payroll). In addition, we and our affiliates obtain a variety of goods (such as supplies and equipment) and services (such as GE Global Research Center) under various master purchasing and service agreements to which GE (and not the Business) is a party. We are billed directly for services we procure under these arrangements.</div>

We use economic hedges when we have exposures to currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting or when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are already recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative, making hedge accounting unnecessary. Even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge, there may be a net effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative and the hedged item.

The rate for 2018 benefited from a lower U.S. statutory rate effective for years beginning in 2018 due to U.S. tax reform and favorable changes in mix of earnings.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘‘U.S. tax reform’’) that lowered the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21%, taxes historic foreign earnings at a reduced rate of tax, establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">The impact of enactment of U.S. tax reform was recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions. Guidance during 2018 could impact the information required for and the calculation of the foreign-derived intangible income (‘‘FDII’’), base erosion anti-abuse tax (‘‘BEAT’’) and global intangible low-taxed income (‘‘GILTI’’) provisions and could affect decisions that affect the tax on various U.S. and foreign items, which would further impact the final amounts included in these provisions and impact the revaluation of deferred taxes. In addition, analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for U.S. tax reform could affect the provisional amount.</div>
        <div class="fpara" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 8pt;">Additionally, as part of tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (‘‘GILTI’’). We have not made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment and, consequently, we have not made an accrual for the deferred tax aspects of this provision.</div>

Issuance of a product warranty constitutes a commitment, which must be accrued as a loss contingency if expenditures under the warranty are both probable and reasonably estimable. The Business provides for estimated product warranty expenses when the related product sale is recognized. Additionally, we may elect certain corrective actions, at our expense, for certain product-related matters impacting our product portfolios. Warranty obligations are recognized for these matters when we commit to these corrective actions and they are estimable. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily based on historical warranty claims experience and outstanding warranty period, claims costs may differ from amounts provided.</div>

The Business believes the likelihood is remote that any such arrangements could have a significant adverse effect on these condensed combined financial statements of the Business.

The Business has off-balance sheet credit exposure through standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, bid bonds, and surety bonds. See Note 12 Borrowings. In addition, our Parent may provide the Business with parent company guarantees in certain jurisdictions where we lack the legal structure to issue the requisite guarantees required on certain projects. We are charged by our Parent the fair market value of such guarantees.</div>
